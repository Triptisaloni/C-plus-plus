Computer Course - C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
C++ is used to create computer programs. Anything from art applications, music players and even video games!
C++ was derived from C, and is largely based on it.

A  C++ program is a collection of commands or statements.
Below is a simple code that has "Hello world!" as its output.

1.Print Hello World

#include<iostream>       
using namespace std;
int main( )
{
cout << ”Hello World”<<endl;
return 0;
}

# is pre processor and iostream is header file, it defines standard stream objects that input and output data.
In our code, the line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std (standard) namespace. 
Program execution begins with the main function, int main()
printf in c = cout in C++
endl moves to next line
scanf in c = cin in C++
The line return 0; terminates the main() function
